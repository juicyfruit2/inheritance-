Create a file named method_override.py and follow the instructions below:
- Take user inputs that ask for the name, age, hair colour, and eye colour of a person.
- Create an adult class  with the following attributes and method:
- name, age, eye_colour, and hair_colour
- Method called can_drive() that prints the name of the person and that they are old enough to drive.
- Create a subclass of the adult class named “Child” that has the same attributes, but overrides the can_drive method to print the persons name and that they are too young to drive.
- Create some logic that determines if the person is 18 or older and create an instance of the Adult class if this is true. Otherwise, create an instance of the
- Child class. Once the object has been created, call the can_drive() method to print out whether the person is old enough to drive or not.
